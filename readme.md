# Super-scan
Detect changed files using PHP/MySQL/CRON

## Introduction

This set of scripts is an evolution from what David K. Lynn offered as a SitePoint article and then through suggestions from Han Wechgelaer.

For the original code and readme, you can check the repository for which this is a fork: [SuperScan](https://github.com/dklynn/SuperScan). Although based on the same original code, this repository is now **very** different from David K. Lynn's version, so I have removed his readme as well.

**Super-scan** is a package built for Laravel that allows simple File change detection and reporting.
